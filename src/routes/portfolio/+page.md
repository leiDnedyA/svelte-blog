**QRPigeon** is a tool for **transferring files** quickly from a mobile device to a PC as fast as possible. Here are the steps for using it:

1. Pull up the website on a desktop device
2. Scan the QR code on your desktop screen with a mobile device
3. On your mobile device, select the images or PDFs that you'd like to send to your desktop
4. Look back at your desktop, and see the file from your mobile device appear automagicallyâ„¢
5. Click the "Download" button on any item on the desktop, and you're done!

**C File Explorer** is a terminal-based file explorer, built with the goal of speeding up navigation in the Linux terminal. This was a great excuse to get better at **C** and the **Linux terminal**!
