# Having Fun Creating a Blog

A few months ago, I got into the habit of reading [hackernews](https://news.ycombinator.com/) articles for at least a few hours every week. 

I've read an _embarrassing_ number of articles and github readmes during this time, my personal favorite being "[start all of your commands with a comma](https://rhodesmill.org/brandon/2009/commands-with-comma/)", which I now do religiously. Eventually, after reading enough articles and seeing people's [home-cooked tech blogs](https://www.robinsloan.com/notes/home-cooked-app/), I started thinking about how I would make my own blog. 

_Will people even read it?_

_What JavaScript framework should I use?_ (svelte)

_How would I store/write my static content?_

These questions made me realize that it would actually be really fun to build out a blog the way that _I wanted it built_, and write about _what I wanted to write about_, I can design the site _how I wanted it to look_, etc. The opportunities to overengineer a website that just serves static markdown seemed endless, so I jumped in.

## How I Did It

If you're just wondering about the libraries that I used, here you go:
- [SvelteKit](https://github.com/sveltejs/kit) & [static adapter](https://kit.svelte.dev/docs/adapter-static) for Svelte w/ routing and static site generation
- [MDsveX](https://github.com/pngwn/mdsvex) for statically rendering markdown as SvelteKit routes
- [Neat CSS](https://neat.joeldare.com/) for some basic CSS boilerplate (found this on HN!)

Additional shoutout to some internal OpenAI training site that I got access to when I worked for [Scale](https://scale.com/), which I scraped a bunch of the code for the cursor spotlight effect from haha

## What I Plan to Do With It

Other than the posts being tech related, I'm not sure what I'll post exactly. Some examples of things that I'd probably have posted about if I had the blog set up at the time are **learning Vim**, **teaching myself touch-typing**, and **how I got my foot in the door of freelancing**.

Basically I'd be writing about what I know, and what I know is beginner/intermediate level programming and career stuff. My **long-term goal**, however, is to build my blogging skills _alongside_ my coding skill so that by the time I get to the really interesting computer science stuff that I want to do, I'll be able to blog about it and share my thoughts easily!

## Conclusion

Overall, building this blog was pretty fun. Worst case scenario, I got practice with GitHub actions and SvelteKit and now have a singular blog post sitting on my porfolio site! If you're a newbie in the tech industry or generally just bored, I definitely recommend spending some time putting a blog together like this, as it's a fun side project and can make your portfolio site look a lot more legit!
