## About Me
I love building tools that make peoples' lives easier, and I love learning new skills. I started coding when I was 12, and since then, seeing people use the things that I create has never gotten old :-)

In my free time, I like to read articles on [Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/), read books, draw, lift weights, learn languages, and contribute to [open source](https://github.com/leiDnedyA)!
