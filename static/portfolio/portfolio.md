Here are some of the projects that I've built that I'm particularly proud of! Additionally, feel free to check out my [Github account](https://github.com/leiDnedyA/)

## QRPigeon | [www.qrpigeon.pics](https://www.qrpigeon.pics/) | [Source Code](https://github.com/leiDnedyA/qr-image-drop/)
**Python** **Flask** **JavaScript** **Linux** **GitHub Actions** **Azure**

QRPigeon is a tool for transferring files quickly from a mobile device to a PC as fast as possible. Here are the steps for using it:

1. Pull up the website on a desktop device
2. Scan the QR code on your desktop screen with a mobile device
3. On your mobile device, select the images or PDFs that you'd like to send to your desktop
4. Look back at your desktop, and see the file from your mobile device appear automagicallyâ„¢
5. Click the "Download" button on any item on the desktop, and you're done!

## C File Explorer | [Source Code](https://github.com/leiDnedyA/c-file-explorer)
**C** **Linux** **Bash**

C File Explorer is a terminal-based file explorer, built with the goal of speeding up navigation in the Linux terminal. This was a great excuse to get better at C and the Linux platform!

Based on your current location, Thrift Router will find the fastest route to all of the thrift stores in your area, and allow you to open the route in Google Maps or Apple Maps!
