Hi! I'm a developer from _Massachusetts_, and currently a Computer Science undergrad student at UMass Boston. Previously, I was a SWE intern at **Fidelity**.

I'm also the president of the UMass Boston Computer Science Club! [Check us out on LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/company/umass-boston-computer-science-club/)

## About Me
I love building tools that make peoples' lives easier, and I love learning new skills. I started coding when I was 12, and since then, seeing people use the things that I create has never gotten old :-)

In my free time, I like to read articles on [Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/), read books, draw, lift weights, learn languages, and contribute to [open source](https://github.com/leiDnedyA)!

### Stuff I Like to Use
- üêç **Python** - My go-to for any experiments or proof-of-concept app ideas
- üìú **TypeScript/JavaScript** - For anything on the web
	- I've had a lot of work experience with **Next.js**, **React**, and **Angular**
	- Fun fact, I started learning JavaScript when I was 11 in 2015!
- ‚òï **Java** - Very nice for building robust backends and APIs
- ‚öôÔ∏è **C & C++** - For low level stuff, **CUDA** programming, and Arduino projects
- üêß **Linux** (Ubuntu) - I seriously love Linux ‚ù§Ô∏è
- ‚úèÔ∏è **[Neovim](neovim/neovim: Vim-fork focused on extensibility and usability)** - My favorite text editor/IDE!

**C** **Linux** **Bash**

C File Explorer is a terminal-based file explorer, built with the goal of speeding up navigation in the Linux terminal. This was a great excuse to get better at C and the Linux platform!
